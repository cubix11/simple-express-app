# Simple Express App Module

## What it is

Simple express app is a module that will build a basic express app based on specifications that you give.  
Some examples of specifications are like the port, typescript, logger, body parser, etc.

## Instructions

Have Node installed  
Open command prompt and type npx simple-express-app  
Answer all the questions  
cd into the directory you chose  
Type npm start

## Important

If the folder is already created, then you cannot have the folder open in an editor.  
The reason is that the module will delete the folder if it exists to make sure no files conflict with each other.  
The solution is just to do it in your terminal and then open the folder in Visual Studio Code
